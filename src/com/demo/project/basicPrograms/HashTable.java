// Hashtables #2
//Given an array containing strings, you have to find duplicate strings in this array. You solve the problem by building a hashtable with those strings and use that hashtable to find duplicates. Which of the following statements are true? (Unless otherwise stated, assume that the hash-function and hash-table are working well and doing a good job.)
    //Pick all that apply
// In most cases, the program will run in O(n) time
// In most cases, the program will run in O(n log n) time
// In most cases, the program will run in O(n^2) time
// If the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in O(n log n) time
// If the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in O(n^2) time
