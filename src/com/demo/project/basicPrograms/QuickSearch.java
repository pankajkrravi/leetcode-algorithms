    //You are given N strings. You must put them in an appropriate in-memory data-structure so that afterwards, you can check whether any given string is present in this data-structure or not. Inserting a new string in the data-structure doesn’t have to be fast, but checking if a given string exists in it should be fast. Which of these data-structures are appropriate for this purpose:
    //
    //Pick all that apply
    // Linked List
    // Priority queue
    // Hashtable
    // B-Tree
